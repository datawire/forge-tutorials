Congratulations!

In this scenario, we've introduced three key concepts:

* the container, which encapsulates your service and all its runtime dependencies, as defined in a `Dockerfile`
* the container registry, which hosts your Docker images
* the Kubernetes manifest, which specifies what/how a Docker image is run

We've also explored ways to automate the process (via Forge).

What next?

1. Set up your own Kubernetes cluster locally (with Minikube), in the cloud (with GKE), or install it yourself on AWS

2. Use [http://forge.sh](http://forge.sh?utm_source=katacoda&utm_medium=tutorial&utm_campaign=tutorial) to deploy your own source code into your Kubernetes installation

3. Send us an email at hello@datawire.io if you have any questions or feedback!
