Congratulations!

In this scenario, we've introduced three key concepts:

* the container, which encapsulates your service and all its runtime dependencies, as defined in a `Dockerfile`
* the container registry, which hosts your Docker images
* the Kubernetes manifest, which specifies what/how a Docker image is run

We've also explored ways to automate the process (via Forge).

What next?

1. Set up your own Kubernetes cluster locally (with [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)), in the cloud (with [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/)), or [install it yourself on AWS](https://www.datawire.io/guide/infrastructure/setting-kubernetes-aws/).

2. Use [http://forge.sh](http://forge.sh?utm_source=katacoda&utm_medium=tutorial&utm_campaign=tutorial) to deploy your own source code into your Kubernetes installation

3. Send us an email at hello@datawire.io if you have any questions or feedback!
