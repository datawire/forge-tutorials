# Forge Tutorials

Use Katacoda. Some notes.

* The Kubernetes image is Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
* If there's a failure in any of the shell scripts, stuff just doesn't happen. (I don't know how you find logs)
* One way to debug is to put your shell script to run in foreground, and then you can see what happens
* The VMs/containers/images whatever appear to be cached. So if you're testing the environments, you need to wait some time before they get refreshed (an hour?).
* Make changes to the markdown, push to GitHub, then in "your profile" click on the "Trigger" link
