# Deploying a service onto Kubernetes

Are you a developer, and want to play around with Kubernetes?

In this tutorial, we'll show you the basics of deploying a service into Kubernetes from source code to a running Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you're going to need a Docker Hub account and your credentials.

## Get started!

To get started with this tutorial, click on the Start Scenario button.

Note: Your environment is being automatically configured, so please wait a few minutes to wait for the scenario configuration to finish (we need to install Python for our web app, and some utilities). You'll see a bunch of text scrolling by, so please wait until you see the shell prompt to begin.
